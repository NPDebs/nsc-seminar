# BACKGROUND

Nurses have been quite accurately referred to as the “backbone of healthcare systems” (Poghosyan & Maier, 2022). 
Formally trained nurses comprise the largest professional group in many countries and make up roughly half the global 
healthcare workforce (Drennan & Ross, 2019). Beyond delivering exceptional care, these professionals streamline the 
delivery of health services and maintain a synergistic workflow between all facets of healthcare provision. 
Nurses are profoundly valued professionals who contribute significantly to the efficiency of global healthcare systems. 
An adequate supply of nurses is necessary for ensuring access to quality care, and for this reason, the decline in the 
number of nurses is a cause for alarm.

A stark warning from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 highlighted a looming global shortage of healthcare workers. 
Their report estimates a current shortfall of 7.2 million, with the demand for nurses alone projected to surge to a staggering 
12.9 million by 2035 (Adams et al., 2021). Already in the United Kingdom, a study by Adams et al (2021) reported that over 41,000 
nursing posts are vacant across the country's National Health Service (NHS), and this is worsened by the fact that there are more 
people leaving the profession than joining it.


The Nigerian healthcare system is not exempted but also faces this significant challenge: a critical shortage of nurses. 
The reasons behind this decline are complex. The problem results from the cumulative and compounding effects of factors such 
as poor policies, limited nursing school capacity, brain drain to developed countries, and unfavourable working conditions 
(Heijden et al., 2019).  These factors create a vicious cycle, where the overworked environment discourages new graduates from 
entering the field, further exacerbating the shortage. A deficit of nursing staff not only obstructs access to quality care but 
also strains current nurses, resulting in burnout and decreased job satisfaction. This seminar explores telehealth as a promising 
solution to bridge this gap and revolutionise nursing practice in Nigeria.

Ultimately, the goal of this study is to lay the foundation for understanding how telemedicine can potentially revolutionise nursing
practice. It is relevant and timely, and can contribute to building a more resilient and efficient healthcare system in Nigeria — one 
that can effectively address the growing needs of the population.


# CURRENT APPLICATIONS OF TELEHEALTH IN HEALTHCARE

With roots dating back to the 1950s, telemedicine has become a dynamic force shaping healthcare delivery on a global scale (Stoltzfus et Al., 2023). Etymologically, the word is derived from a Greek root word "tele" which means "distance.” The World Health Organization (WHO) defines telemedicine as "The delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor, by health care professionals using information and communications technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health care providers, all in the interest of advancing the health of individuals and their communities (WHO, 1997).”
